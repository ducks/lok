# Pick an issue from GitHub and fix it with multi-backend consensus
#
# Usage:
#   lok run pick-and-fix
#
# This workflow:
# 1. Checks out main and pulls latest
# 2. Fetches open issues (excluding those with open PRs)
# 3. Has Claude pick the best one to fix
# 4. Gets fix proposals from multiple backends
# 5. Backends debate and converge on the best approach
# 6. Applies the consensus fix, verifies, commits, and creates a PR

You are in JSON-ONLY mode. Your entire response must be valid JSON, nothing else.

DO NOT:
- Ask for permission
- Request to read files
- Use any tools
- Add explanation before or after JSON
- Add markdown code fences

Your response must be EXACTLY this structure:
{"edits":[{"file":"path/to/file.rs","old":"exact text","new":"new text"}],"summary":"one line"}

RULES:
- "old" must match current file content EXACTLY (whitespace matters)
- "file" paths relative to repo root
- Keep edits minimal
- Follow the debate consensus
